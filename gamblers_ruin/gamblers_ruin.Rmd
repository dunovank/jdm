This document provides an example of the problem of "gamblers ruin", which demonstrates a problem for motivating utility maximization using the law of large numbers.  This notebook simulates how many times one would need to play a positive-value lottery in order to come out ahead.  


```{r, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(

  sliderInput("pwinexp", label = "Probability of winning the lottery (10e-x)",
              min = 1, max = 9, value = 3, step = 1),
  sliderInput("costperplay", label = "Cost to play the lottery",
              min = 1, max = 10, value = 1, step = 1),
  sliderInput("nplayers", label = "Number of players",
              min = 1, max = 1000, value = 100, step = 1)
  
)

play_lottery=function(pwin,costperplay,nplayers,maxplays=100000){
  prewinloss=c()
  nwinners=0
  for (i in 1:nplayers) {
    win=0
    p=0
    while (win==0 && p<maxplays){
      p=p+1
      if (runif(1)<pwin) {
        win=1
      }
    }
    nwinners=nwinners+win
    prewinloss=c(prewinloss,p*costperplay)
  }
  return(list('prewinloss'=prewinloss,'nwinners'=nwinners,'maxplays'=maxplays,'nplayers'=nplayers))
}

dataInput <- reactive({
  p=play_lottery(10^(-1*input$pwinexp),input$costperplay,input$nplayers)
  return(p)
})

renderPlot({
  i=dataInput()
  hist(i$prewinloss)
  })

renderUI({
   i=dataInput()

    HTML(sprintf('Maximum loss before winning: %0.2f<br>',max(i$prewinloss)),
         sprintf('Minimum loss before winning: %0.2f<br>',min(i$prewinloss)),
         sprintf('Proportion of winners after maximum of %d plays: %0.2f<br>',i$maxplays,i$nwinners/i$nplayers),
         sep = '<br/>')
